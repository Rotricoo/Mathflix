## <strong> About the Project </strong>

Matlfix is a personal take on recreating Netflix’s homepage, inspired by the 7-day Challenge from Alura. What makes this project unique is that it’s a personalized gift for my husband, featuring his favorite movies and series.

This project challenged me to push beyond the initial requirements of the challenge by adding custom features, and I plan to continuously expand its functionality.
